            <h4>Important Privacy Information Regarding ChildCinema</h4 >
        
            <p class="m">
                Before your child begins using the service, we want to ensure that you comprehend how the app collects and utilizes
                personal information, as well as the privacy controls at your disposal.
            </p>
        
            <p class="m"> 
                You have opted to utilize ChildCinema as a signed-out service. This implies that a Google account is not necessary
                for the app to function.
            </p>
        
            <h3 >Information Collection:</h3>
        
            <p class="m">
                <strong>ChildCinema collects information based on your child's app usage, such as when they watch a video.</strong> This includes:
            </p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Device information, such as hardware model and operating system version.</li>
                <li>Log information detailing service usage, device events, and the device's IP address.</li>
                <li>Unique application numbers, like the application version number.</li>
                <li>Unique identifiers used to collect and store app or device information, such as preferred language, app
                    activity, and other settings.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p class="m">
                App activity information encompasses the videos your child watches, search terms, and other interactions with
                content and ads in the app. If your child uses audio features like voice search, the app briefly collects and
                processes voice information, which is immediately deleted.
            </p>
        
            <h4>How We Use the Information:</h4>
        
            <p class="m">
                The collected information is used for internal operational purposes, including spam and abuse prevention,
                enforcing content license restrictions, determining preferred language, and enhancing the service.
            </p>
        
            <p class="m">
                We also leverage this information to provide users with personalized content. An identifier unique to the app is
                associated with the videos your child has watched and the terms they've searched to recommend content likely to be
                of interest, as per the controls described below.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Unique identifiers are utilized for contextual advertising, including ad frequency capping. ChildCinema does not
                permit interest-based advertising or remarketing.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                ChildCinema prohibits the sharing of personal information with third parties or making it publicly available.
            </p>
        
            <h4 >Information Sharing:</h4>
        
            <p>
                Individual user information will not be disclosed outside of Google unless one of the following circumstances
                applies:
            </p>
        
            <ol >
                <li class="m"><strong>With Consent:</strong> Sharing with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google when
                    parental consent is obtained.</li>
                <li class="m"><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> Sharing information in good faith when necessary to meet applicable laws,
                    regulations, legal processes, or enforceable governmental requests; enforce Terms of Service; investigate
                    potential violations; detect, prevent, or address fraud, security, or technical issues; or protect against
                    harm to the rights, property, or safety of Google, users, or the public.</li>
                <li class="m"><strong>For External Processing:</strong> Providing individual user information to affiliates or trusted
                    businesses or persons for processing, based on instructions and compliance with privacy policies and security
                    measures.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <h4>Parental Access and Controls:</h4>
        
            <ul class="m">
                <li>Access your child's recently watched videos in the "Watch it again" section.</li>
                <li>Pause the collection of watch and search history or clear it in the parental settings section.</li>
                <li>While history is paused, the app won't use new views or search terms to recommend content.</li>
                <li>Clearing watch and search history resets Recommended and "Watch it again" videos.</li>
                <li>Uninstalling and reinstalling the app on a device resets app-specific identifiers used for collecting
                    history.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p  >
                For additional details about the app, refer to the <a href="">ChildCinema Privacy Notice </a>and the <a href="">Parental Guide</a>. We encourage
                you to review our Disclosure for Children with your child to explain our data processing practices to them.
